1. Welcome to Git World.

To Overwrite changes of local with current remote file.

git fetch
git checkout origin/master filename 

(Note: we need to give exact path of filename.
ex: I have a file called overwrite.txt under src/media/js/overwrite.txt)

In that case

git fetch
git checkout origin/master src/media/js/overwrite.txt


To Overwrite all files with remote.

git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master

At this point, if you add ant new files which are not present in remote , then still it shows when you run the git status.

so if you want to delete newly added files in your local.run below command.

git clean -f (Note: It will delete all your local newly added files.)
