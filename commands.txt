To Overwrite changes of local with current remote file.

git fetch
git checkout origin/master filename 

(Note: we need to give exact path of filename.
ex: I have a file called overwrite.txt under src/media/js/overwrite.txt)

In that case

git fetch
git checkout origin/master src/media/js/overwrite.txt
